### To record
All the recording functions are handled on the left side. You need to name it and enter a capture port. When you stop capturing all the packets are saved to `APPDATA/LocalLow/swolekat/vmc-replay/`.  

### Replaying 
On the right side you can play back the file. If you check the Loop checkmark it'll continuously play back the packets. If you press start it'll just play it back once. The delete button will delete the file.
